Getting started on OpenERP can be a bit daunting, initially this behemoth can be really painful. However once you get familiar with the system everything is really easy. In this tutorial I'll go through the steps involved in adding an additional field to an existing model and adding it to an existing view. We'll also do this by creating a custom module, so we will also cover some of the basics for doing that as well.


## Some context you say?

For this example, assume that we are about to migrate out internal project management system to OpenERP, and when we migrate any existing projects over we want an extra field where we can put a reference to the original project management system ID. Essentially modifying the OpenERP project model.


## Getting started

We'll start with a clean install of OpenERP version 7, I wont go into how to install, however I might do so at a later date if there is enough demand. For now you can check out this helpful installation tutorial [here](http://www.theopensourcerer.com/2012/12/how-to-install-openerp-7-0-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts/). Once the database is set up go to **Settings >> Modules >> Apps** and enable the **Project management** app.

So now that's done, if you go into the Projects view and click on create you should get something like so.

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/1_0.png" width="1064" height="599" alt=""  />

What we want from this view is to add a field under where the customer field is, called **Legacy ID** right about where I've drawn the red block in this image.

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/2_0.png" width="1064" height="599" alt=""  />

So lets get to it.


## Where to put things

The module directory in OpenERP is located in the folder **/OPENERP_ROOT/openerp/addons** you can put your modules in there or symlink them into that directory but to make upgrading OpenERP core cleaner, there's a better way.

Create a new folder outside of the **OPENERP_ROOT** folder and call it something useful, I've called mine **custom_modules**

In the newly created module directory create an **\_\_init\_\_.py** file with the following code.

{% highlight python %}
from openerp.modules import get_module_resource, get_module_path
{% endhighlight %}

This tells the system that this directory will contain addons/modules. Now when we run OpenERP, we have to tell the system about this new additional addons directory. This can be done in the config file (good for production servers) with the **addons_path** or via the command line (better for development) at start up like so.

{% highlight python %}
python openerp-server --addons-path=openerp/addons,../custom_modules
{% endhighlight %}

However, if you run this right now, it will fail with the following error

{% highlight python %}
openerp-server: error: option --addons-path: The addons-path '../custom_modules' does not seem to a be a valid Addons Directory!
{% endhighlight %}

This is because we haven't actually created any modules there yet, so lets get on with it.


## A basic module

Create a new folder in the **custom_modules** folder and name it **legacy_projects**. In this folder create an **\_\_init\_\_.py** file but leave it empty for now. For OpenERP to recognise it We also need to create a module declaration file. In the same folder create a file called **\_\_openerp\_\_.py**  inside this file we will put the following.

{% highlight python %}
{
    'name': "Legacy project integration",
    'version': "1.0",
    'author': "thepearson",
    'category': "Tools",
    'depends': ['project'],
    'data': [],
    'demo': [],
    'installable': True,
}
{% endhighlight %}

I wont go into details about this file for now, (you can read up on it [here](https://doc.openerp.com/6.0/developer/2_4_module_development/module_structure/#openerp-module-descriptor-file-openerp-py)) but suffice to say that it tells OpenERP about our module. Now, if you fire up the server it should kick into action.

Lets do that.

At this point, to help with enabling custom modules it's useful to enable some permissions on our user account. Log in (with administrator or an account that has administrative privs) and navigate to **Settings >> Users** and edit your user account. Enable the **Technical features** check-box under usability.

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/3_0.png" width="672" height="386" alt=""  />

Sweet, save your account and refresh your browser. You should now see a whole bunch of extra menu items on the left. One we are looking for in particular is **Update modules list** click on that and then click update. This will refresh the system module cache.

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/4.png" width="464" height="314" alt=""  />

Now if we go to the **Installed modules** section and delete the tag **Installed** from the search box and search for **legacy project** the module you just created should display.

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/5.png" width="863" height="436" alt=""  />

Great, this is how we'd also install the module, but before we do lets make it do something useful first.


### Uh, a little help?

Something that makes development in OpenERP a little easier is **Developer Mode** so lets turn that on now. Log in as administrator, click on the dropdown menu at the top right and then click on **About OpenERP** in the modal that pops up is an **Activate the developer mode** link, click on that.

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/6.png" width="582" height="356" alt=""  />

Developer mode gives you the ability to inspect views and models from the interface so you don't have to go trawling through code and/or database schemas to figure out what's going on. It gives you a menu at the top of the page with some handy developer links and if you're looking at a view you want to modify you can hover over a field to see technical information about it, like below.

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/7.png" width="764" height="396" alt=""  />

As you can see from that screenshot our model (or object) is called **project.project** We'll use that in the next step.


## Making changes to an existing model

First up we want to tell the OpenERP about the new field, [OpenObject](https://launchpad.net/openobject) is the ORM framework behind OpenERP and adding additional fields to existing models is easy.

First up lets create a file inside our **legacy_projects** module and save it it **legacy_projects.py**. We also need to tell our module to load that file, so in the **\_\_init\_\_.py** file put the following:

{% highlight python %}
import legacy_projects
{% endhighlight %}

Sweet, now in the **legacy_projects.py** file put the following.

{% highlight python %}
from openerp.osv import fields, osv

class legacy_projects(osv.osv):

  _inherit = "project.project"

  _columns = {
    'legacy_projects_id': fields.integer('Legacy project ID', size=11)
  }

  _defaults ={
    'legacy_projects_id': 0
  }

legacy_projects()
{% endhighlight %}

In the first line we import the required classes, then we define our class.

The real magic starts with the line **_inherit = "project.project** basically we are telling the system that our object inherits an existing object.

**_columns** is where we define our field, **legacy_projects_id**. I have created it as an integer, gave it a title and set the max ength to 11.

There is a bunch of different fields you can add to an object, again I wont go into then but you can find all of them [here](https://doc.openerp.com/trunk/server/03_module_dev_02/#type-of-fields).

Lastly we define some **_defaults** for fields. In this instance (while not really helpful, but I put it in for clarity) we default the field **legacy_projects_id** to 0.

That's the model/object modifications done now. Time to add the interface.


## The user interface

In OpenERP the UI is controlled and formatted using XML files.

In our module folder create a new file called **legacy_projects.xml**. We also need to let OpenERP know about it, so update the line in the  **\_\_openerp\_\_.py** file that reads:

{% highlight python %}
'data': [],
{% endhighlight %}

and make it read:

{% highlight python %}
'data': ['legacy_projects.xml'],
{% endhighlight %}

Now in the **legacy_projects.xml** file place the following:

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<openerp>
  <data>
    <record model="ir.ui.view" id="legacy_projects_project">
        <field name="name">project.project.form</field>
        <field name="model">project.project</field>
        <field name="inherit_id" ref="project.edit_project" />
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <xpath expr="/form/sheet/group/group[2]/field[@name='partner_id']" position="after">
                <field name="legacy_projects_id" />
            </xpath>
        </field>
    </record>
  </data>
</openerp>
{% endhighlight %}

Without getting into too much detail about the views the important pieces of this code are the **record** tag where we define our view's id.

Next we have the view **name**, **object** (model) and a **reference** to the view we are inheriting.

Since, we are inheriting another modules view, we dont get to define this info, we have to look it up. To do this information, make sure developer mode is enabled, go to the view we are changing then in the developer drop down menu at the top click on **Manage views** You'll see something like the following.

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/8.png" width="1102" height="538" alt=""  />

In the table you can see **View name**, **Object** and **External ID** these map to **name**, **model** and **inherit_id** respectfully.

The next section has an Xpath expression in it with the **position** attribute, this tells the system to put the field **legacy_projects_id** AFTER the node represented in the Xpath.

If you're wondering how you figure out where you want to put the field. Use **Development mode**. While in the **Manage views** section, with the current view selected, click **edit**. That's your view XML. Cool huh?

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/9.png" width="969" height="711" alt=""  />


### Cool, now make it work.

Ok, ok, enough with the details, let's go turn this thing on. Navigate to **Settings >> Installed Modules**. Click on the **Update module list** link on the left, and then like before search for you're module. This time lets enable it.

**NOTE: If the above doesn't work, you may need to restart the server and then either update or uninstall/install your module**

Things should whir away for a while and if all is well, your module will be enabled. Let's go an create a new project and see, navigate to the **Projects** page and hit **Create**

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/10.png" width="1151" height="528" alt=""  />

**Bingo** Look now we have a new field under the Customer field **Legacy Project ID** and hovering over it in developer mode, we can see it's the field we created.

<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/openerp/11.png" width="324" height="174" alt=""  />

If we create a project and enter a value in this field it will be saved to the database, OpenERP does all the work for us. In fact this post seems awfully long for how little code we've actually done. Here is what our saved Project looks like.

### Are you done yet?

So there you have it, doesn't OpenERP look easy. :D Hopefully this totorial has made sense and has been helpful. I've posted the source for the code in this tutorial on github, there's a link after the article. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions, or if you want me to cover another OpenERP topic.
