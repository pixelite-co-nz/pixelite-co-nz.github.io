As of the 28 February 2014, Drupal 8 now requires a minimum PHP version of 5.4.2. For background information read [the drupal.org issue](https://drupal.org/node/1498574).

This places everyone running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in an awkward situation as the PHP version bundled with this release is [PHP 5.3.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+source/php5).

Luckily there are options to solve this:

## Perform a dist-upgrade to 14.04 LTS ##

This may not be the easiest option, but I mention it for completeness, as this newer version of Ubuntu (Trusty Tahr) [contains PHP 5.5.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/trusty/+source/php5) out of the box.

## Add a PPA and install newer a newer version of PHP ##

For most people this will be the easiest option. For PHP 5.4.x run the command:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5-oldstable
{% endhighlight %}

or for PHP 5.5.x run:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5
{% endhighlight %}

And then update your packages:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
{% endhighlight %}

The PPA maintainer has more information on the launchpad site https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/php5

### Common issues ###

I was getting the message "The following packages have been kept back" when running the upgrade command earlier

{% highlight bash %}
seanh /var/www/D8 git:8.x Â» sudo apt-get upgrade
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following packages have been kept back:
  libapache2-mod-php5 linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic php-pear php5-cli php5-common php5-curl php5-dev php5-gd php5-mcrypt php5-mysql php5-pgsql php5-xdebug
{% endhighlight %}

This was solved by manually installing the packages:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install php-pear php5-cli php5-common php5-curl php5-dev php5-gd php5-mcrypt php5-mysql php5-pgsql php5-xdebug
{% endhighlight %}

### Update 2 June 2015

An alternative to the above command is

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
{% endhighlight %}

This will update the packages, but will not update the Ubuntu release (hattip @Ben Coleman and @abowman).

## Comments ##

Let me know if this worked for you in the comments, or if you have another way to easily update PHP on your stack.
